# Things3 to Markdown

[Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is a to do list app for macOS and iPadOS and iOS.

This script converts Things3 logbook into a Markdown file. You can view the output file in any Markdown editor, or note-taking apps such as [Obsidian](Obsidian.md).

To dos are sorted by completed dates, and group by projects or areas if they exist.

Tags and notes are also inlcuded.

## Acknowledgments

- This script uses a powerful Python library [things.py](https://github.com/thingsapi/things.py).
- Inspired by [Obsidian Things Logbook](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-things-logbook) plugin.
